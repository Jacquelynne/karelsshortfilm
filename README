Welcome folks!

This short film was the culminating project (an open ended final) for Stanford's "Code in Place 2020". 

Thousands of people from around the world joined to learn the basics of Python- through two fantastic professors and individual section leaders.

The code runs with a library distinct to Stanford. I will be posting that when I am able to access it.

Files needed are attached in the "images" folder. Feel free to find the tkinter library before me!

Enjoy!
